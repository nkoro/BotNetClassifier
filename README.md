# BotNetClassifier
Botnet classification task involves the identification of botnets in network traffic or network logs. Random Forest (RF) is a machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification tasks such as botnet classification. RF is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to make a final classification decision.

To perform a botnet classification task using RF, the first step is to gather network traffic or network log data that contains features that can distinguish between normal traffic and botnet traffic. These features may include network flow characteristics, payload content, and protocol behavior.

Next, the data needs to be preprocessed to prepare it for the classification task. This may involve data cleaning, normalization, feature selection, and feature engineering. Once the data is prepared, it is split into training and testing sets.

The RF algorithm is trained on the training set, using the labeled data to learn the characteristics of botnet and normal traffic. Once the model is trained, it is used to classify the testing set. The accuracy of the classification is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

Overall, RF is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can be used for botnet classification tasks. Its ability to handle high-dimensional data with complex features makes it an attractive choice for this type of task
